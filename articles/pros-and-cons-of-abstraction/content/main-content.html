		<h1>What is Abstraction?</h1>
		<p class="sub-title">An act-of-mind where we focus on some aspects of a thing, while deliberately ignoring all others. It is the “reverse” process of reduction, going from the specific to the general, and comes before reduction in the reasoning process.</p>
		<section>
			<strong>Summary:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>When we “abstract”, we focus on specific aspects of a thing in our minds, while ignoring all other aspects.</li>
				<li>Abstraction is powerful: we can take what we learnt from one situation, and apply it to a different situation.</li>
				<li>Confusing our abstract notions with the underlying reality is a constant danger — the map is not the territory!</li>
				<li>Abstractions are a poor way to introduce a subject, leading to confusion and error: much better to start with the real things that are the concrete starting points for the abstractions themselves.</li>

		<h2>The Power of Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			So, we know that the bricks, blocks and bales are all “cuboids” — what’s the advantage of knowing this? 
		</p>
		<p>
			Since all the “cuboids” have the same general shape, they can be “stacked” together the same way, leaving no gaps between them (unlike trying to stack apples, for example).
		</p>
		<p>
			If the farmer has moved wooden blocks before and knows he can fit 50 wooden blocks of a given size on his cart, he could work out roughly how may red bricks he could fit without manually checking.
		</p>
		<p>
			All he’d have to do is work out the ratio between their sizes, and he would have a reasonable estimate of how many bricks he could carry.  Since the bricks are smaller than the wooden blocks, he can safely reason that he can carry more bricks than wooden blocks, for the same amount of space.
		</p>
		<p>
			Same if he wanted to carry straw bales, instead of wooden blocks: since each straw bale is much bigger than the wooden blocks, he could carry fewer straw bales than wooden blocks.
		</p>
		<p>
			
			That is, the similarity in shape between the red bricks, wooden blocks and the straw bales allow the farmer to make predictions as to how many red bricks and straw bales that he can stack on his cart, based only on what he knows about hauling wooden blocks.
		</p>
		<h3>
			We can abstract an abstraction too…
		</h3>
		<p>
			We don’t have to start the abstraction process with a concrete object, and end with a notion of those concrete objects alone.
			We can abstract an idea into a more general one, and apply that more general idea to both classes of concrete objects in the real world, but also to ideas in the mind. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Our farmer has the concept of “cuboid”, but he can abstract the shapes of other non-block-like things and recognize that these other shapes occupy space in a similar way to the cuboids. Building a stack of bricks, he notices that the stack must occupy the same amount of “space” as the sum of all the blocks that went into making it! 
		</p>
		<p>
			The farmer begins to form the even more abstract idea of “volume”, a property common to all shapes, regardless of what they look like. In a blinding flash of realization, the farmer realizes that all shapes —be they wedge, plank, brick or ball —all occupy space, and he can compare their “space-taking-up” directly, through the more abstract concept of “volume” (at least in theory).
		</p>
		<p>
			A stack of 100 identical blocks takes up 100 “blocks of space”, and so his initial abstraction of “shape” leads the farmer into thinking of ways to calculate how much space a stack of blocks occupies.
		</p>
		<p>
			Initially, his calculation of volume is made by crude reckoning, by counting the blocks that make up a stack, but it represents a crucial conceptual leap made possible by the power of abstraction.

		<h2>
			The Downsides of Abstraction
		</h2>
		<p>
			Abstraction is awesome, what could possibly go wrong!?
		</p>
		<p>
			Great! 
		</p>
		<p>		
			The farmer can figure out how many red bricks he can bring home from market, based on his previous experience with moving wooden blocks: he uses his abstraction of the shape of the wooden blocks, to make a prediction about the unfamiliar situation of hauling red bricks.
		</p>
		<p>
			Isn’t abstraction wonderful? We can re-use our learnings from one familiar situation and apply it for free to an unfamiliar situation —all without having to exert any effort
		</p>
		<p>
			Woo-hoo!<br/>Hurray for abstraction —nothing could go wrong!
		</p>
		<p>
			Well, let’s see about that…
		</p>
		<h3>
		The map is not the territory…</h3>
		<p>
			Assume our farmer is a total ignoramus regarding hauling red bricks and assumes that only the shape of things matter.		
		</p>
		<p>
			Enamored by his abstract reasoning, he dutifully stacks his cart with the calculated number of red bricks, and —BANG! —his entire cart collapses!<br/>
			What happened?
		</p>
		<p>
			Well, when we abstract, we deliberately leave out certain details, which is perfectly fine, depending on the circumstances: if our farmer is counting apples, he doesn’t care about their colour for example.
		</p>
		<p>
			The problem arises when we forget that our abstractions are just a “mental map” of the world, but they are NOT the world itself. There is a famous warning to remind us that “the map is not the territory”, and we would do well to keep it in mind, lest we leave out crucial details.
		</p>
		<p>
			By treating his abstraction of the bricks as if they were the real thing, the farmer has committed the fallacy of “reification”, which is treating an abstract notion as if it were a concrete thing.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Teach real things first, not abstractions		
		</h3>
		<p>
			Another serious downside of abstractions is that they are, by definition, detached and distant from the “real” world, the world of everyday sense experience that we are most comfortable with.
		</p>
		<p>
			But academics love their abstractions, eulogizing their timeless and detached nature, remote from the muddled vicissitudes of the mundane everyday world we inhabit.
		</p>
		<p>
			This leads to abstractions, such as scientific formulae, being placed on a pedagogical pedestal, elevated above all other things in the teaching of students. I hold this approach to the farmer placing the cart before the ass, and expecting progress to be made —literally, it is an “ass-backwards” approach to education.

		<h2>
			Takeaway
		</h2>
		<p>
			Abstraction is the mental process of going from a concrete thing in the real world, to an idea of that thing in the mind: in doing so, we ignore some aspects of the thing, while focusing on others.
