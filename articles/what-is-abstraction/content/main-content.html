		<h1>What is Abstraction?</h1>
		<p class="sub-title">An act-of-mind where we focus on some aspects of a thing, while deliberately ignoring all others. It is the “reverse” process of reduction, going from the specific to the general, and comes before reduction in the reasoning process.</p>

			<strong>Summary:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>When we “abstract”, we focus on specific aspects of a thing in our minds, while ignoring all other aspects.</li>
				<li>The “abstract” exists only in our minds, while the “concrete” refers to things in the real world.</li>
				<li>Abstraction allows us to create “concepts”, which are categories of things in the mind, e.g. the idea of “blocks” of wood</li>
				<li>We can abstract from concrete things to form specific concepts, and then abstract from those specific concepts to more general concepts.</li>

					The word “abstract” is of Latin origin and means “to draw away from”, which is perfect description of the process of abstraction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Abstraction is an act-of-mind, where we take some thing in the world (a physical object or an idea), and we focus on some aspects of it, while ignoring all others. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We abstract a thing to create a more general notion of that thing in our minds.

				That which is “abstract” exists only in the mind and has no physical form.</p>
				<p>
					The opposite of “abstract” in philosophical terms is “concrete”, which refers to something in the real world, with actual physical substance that you can experience with the senses.

					When we look at a pile of wooden blocks, we can distinguish the individual blocks as separate concrete entities, but we recognize they have some properties in common. 
				</p>
				<p>
					That list of qualities that they share in common (e.g. made of wood, cuboid shape etc.) allows us to place these different entities into the same abstract group in our minds, the group we label “block”.
				</p>
				<p>
					This abstract group can be called an abstraction, an idea, a notion or a concept. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I’ll use the word <strong>concept</strong>, as its Latin etymology (<strong>con</strong>, together; <strong>capio</strong>, to take) captures the process just described: the taking of different things together as one.

					When a baby sees a wooden block, light-rays are reflected from the surface of the block into the baby’s eyes. Then, through a complex series of steps, a mental “image” of the block is formed in the baby’s mind.
				</p>
				<p>
					The technical term for this mental image is a <strong>percept</strong>: a mental impression of an object obtained through the use of the senses. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The baby cannot describe this as a “block”, as it has no notion of a “block”. When the baby sees another wooden block, it perceives another unique object, totally different to the first block.

					These two percepts are not integrated together in the mind of the baby, as they would be in the mind of an adult.  
				</p>
				<p>
					An adult would organize these two percepts (of the two different blocks) under the single notion of “block”, and use the word “block” to denote their mental classification.
				</p>
				<p>
	             	What the baby lacks is the “concept” of a block, where a “concept” is a classification of different percepts based on some criteria that unites them.

			Concepts are formed by abstraction

					Compare a farmer looking at these two different blocks: unlike the baby, he can unite these two things under the concept of “block”.
				</p>
				<p>
					But how is the concept of “block” formed? 
				</p>
				<p>
					When looking at a range of concrete things (blocks), we see at first their individual differences: but with an abstract perspective, we notice certain things are constant between them.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the blocks, they have a general shape, a form, which is common to them all.	
				</p>
				<p>
					By selectively ignoring the individual differences, and focusing only on their common shape, we can create a category in our minds, a concept, which we will label “block”.
				</p>
				<p>
					Under this concept, we can place any concrete item that fits the relevant criteria.

	<h2>Abstracting Abstractions</h2>

				<p>
					When we formed the concept of “block” earlier, we did so from directly perceiving wooden things in the real world.
				</p>
				<p>
					We can call this concept a “first order” or “specific” concept, since the concept has a direct physical referent: you could easily distinguish and point out a “block” if asked.
				</p>
				<p>
					But the process of abstraction (and thus concept formation) doesn’t have to stop with specific concepts: we can abstract again to form a higher-order conception.

			We can abstract an abstraction

					An example: a farmer at market observes the following “concrete” things:
					<ul>
					 	<li>wooden blocks,</li>
					 	<li>clay bricks,</li>
					 	<li>bales of straw.</li>
					 </ul> 
				</p>
				<p>
					Yes, each of these things are concretely different, with different weights, sizes, textures and densities. The clay bricks are smaller and heavier than the blocks, and the bales of straw are the largest of the lot, but also the lightest.
				</p>
				<p>
					But we can abstract out these details, focusing only on the general “shape” of each of them, we discover that they share the same general structure: they are all 3-D rectangles, “cuboids”.

		<h3>
			Higher-order concepts are more inclusive
		</h3>
		<div class="subSec_wrap">
			<div>
				<p>
					This concept of “cuboid” is a higher-order concept, a more general concept than the individual specific concepts of brick, block or bale.  
				</p>
				<p>
					The concept of “cuboid” takes in the lower-level specific concepts, it <strong>subsumes</strong> them, within its more general definition.

	<h2>
		Takeaway
	</h2>
	<p>
		Abstraction is the mental process of going from a concrete thing in the real world, to an idea of that thing in the mind: in doing so, we ignore some aspects of the thing, while focusing on others.

Notes
Old: “Abstraction” is the process of separating out some aspects of a thing (while deliberately ignoring other aspects), and forming an idea of those aspects in the mind, e.g. the length of a wire, while ignoring what it is made of etc. 
Vs.
New: When we “abstract”, we separate out specific aspects of a thing in our minds, while deliberately ignoring all other aspects.  When measuring the length of a wire, when do not care what it’s made of, only its extension in one direction.
