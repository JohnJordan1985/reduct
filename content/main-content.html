				If “abstraction” is the process of going from the things we can directly observe, to the concepts that we can only imagine, then “reduction” is the <strong>reverse</strong> process.
			</p>
			<p>
				To <strong>reduct</strong> a concept is to trace that concept back, step-by-step, to its originating source in the things that we can directly experience.

			<p>If you were confused by the math and science taught in
			school, you are not alone.</p>

			<p>My experience was being <strong>bombarded with hieroglyphs</strong> that
			somehow contrived to explain things in the real world.</p>

			<p>How could anyone come up with things like the quadratic
			formula, the volume of a sphere, F = ma, or the exponential constant?</p>

			<p><strong>No.</strong></p>

			<p>I blame the way these subjects are taught in school.</p>

			<p>Rather than draw out scientific concepts from their concrete
				origins, they present the <strong>abstract end-points
				(formulae)</strong> as if they sprang forth – fully-formed! – from the minds of geniuses

				<h2>Where did these <strong>formulae come from?</strong></h2>

			<p>But did these ideas spring forth – fully-formed! – from the
			minds of geniuses?</p>

			<p>Or, is there a <strong>process</strong> – accessible to all – that was
			followed, which allowed these discoveries to be made?</p>

			<p>I believe that, while none of us might ever be an Einstein,
			we can at least <strong>understand</strong> how they came to their results.</p>

				<h2>You too can understand this stuff!</h2>

			<p>And how can us mere mortals understand how Archimedes,

			<p>By the <strong>process of “reduction”</strong>: the tracing of an abstract
				concept back to its originating source in the “real” world – the world of
			everyday experience.</p>

			<p>This blog will do exactly this: it will <strong>blow away the
				mystery and confusion</strong> about scientific and mathematical topics, and show that
			all these abstractions originate in the experiences of the everyday world.</p>
